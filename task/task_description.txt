In the attachment JSON (a1s.rtf) and JPG-picture.

JSON provides a graph of roads and other information.
The JPG picture is used as the background image of the map.

(There are no limitations on supported versions of ios: it is desirable to use swift as the programming language.)

The essence of the problem:

We need to develop a demo application and send us the source of the finished project.
A map (JPG picture in the attachment) should be displayed on the screen.

When tapping on the map, the starting point of the route is selected. 

At the second tap, the final point on the map is selected, and the shortest route from the initial to the final point is laid. 

The next tap resets the selected points and route.
